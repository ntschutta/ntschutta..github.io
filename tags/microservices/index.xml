      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-abstract&#34;&gt;Full Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, you can’t swing a dry erase marker without hitting someone talking about microservices. Developers are studying Eric Evan’s prescient book Domain Driven Design. Teams are refactoring monolithic apps, looking for bounded contexts and defining a ubiquitous language. And while there have been countless articles, videos, and talks to help you convert to microservices, few have spent any appreciable time asking if a given application should be a microservice. In this talk, I will show you a set of factors you can apply to help you decide if something deserves to be a microservice or not. We’ll also look at what we need to do to maintain a healthy micro(services)biome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many good reasons to use a microservices architecture. But there are no free lunches. The positives of microservices come with added complexity. Teams should happily take on that complexity&amp;hellip;provided the application in question benefits from the upside of microservices. This talk will cut through the hype to help you make the right choice for your unique situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsible Microservices is based on my blog series &lt;a href=&#34;https://content.pivotal.io/blog/should-that-be-a-microservice-keep-these-six-factors-in-mind&#34;&gt;Should that be a Microservice? Keep These Six Factors in Mind&lt;/a&gt; found on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://content.pivotal.io/blog&#34;&gt;Pivotal blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evolving to Cloud Native</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-abstract&#34;&gt;Full Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every organization has at least a phalanx or two in the “Cloud” and it is, understandably changing the way we architect our systems. But your application portfolio is full of &amp;ldquo;heritage&amp;rdquo; systems that hail from the time before everything was as a service. Not all of those applications will make it to the valley beyond, how do you grapple with your legacy portfolio? This talk will explore the strategies, tools and techniques you can apply as you evolve towards a cloud native future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to evaluate your legacy applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to take those heritage systems to the Cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what 12 Factors means for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where it makes sense to use microservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what tools and services you&#39;ll need to add to your repertoire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Cloud Native Culture</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-abstract&#34;&gt;Full Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift to cloud computing involves a veritable plethora of new technologies and approaches. From 12 factors to domain driven design, change is afoot. Your organization is knee deep in functions and platforms and containers and while the technology is important, we can’t afford to overlook the importance of culture. What changes when we go to the cloud? How do we get there? How does Conways law affect the success of our efforts? How can we help people navigate the latest evolution in computing? This talk will explore how cloud native computing impacts more than just our architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-abstract&#34;&gt;Full Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we migrate towards distributed applications, it is more than just our architectures that are changing, so too are the structures of our teams. The Inverse Conway Maneuver tells us small, autonomous teams are needed to produce small, autonomous services. Architects are spread thin and can’t be involved with every decision. Today, we must empower our teams but we need to ensure our teams are making good choices. How do we do that? How do you put together a cohesive architecture around distributed teams? This talk will discuss creating “paved roads”, well worn paths that we know works and we can support. We will also explore the importance of fitness functions to help our teams adopt appropriate designs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Architecting Cloud Native Applications</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-abstract&#34;&gt;Full Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now your organization has planted a flag in “the Cloud” and it is up to you to figure out just what that means to your application portfolio. Should everything be a microservice? Wait, what is a microservices anyway? How do you deal with massively distributed applications? What do you do with your legacy portfolio? In this presentation, we will walk through how the cloud impacts are applications and what we can do to successfully move our organizations forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;topics&#34;&gt;Topics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud native culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain driven design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of paved roads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chaos engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production Hardened Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note Architecting Cloud Native Applications can also be delivered as a workshop from 3 hours to 2 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
